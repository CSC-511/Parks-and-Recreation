# parks-and-recreation

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

Created a web-based application with a team that allows the user to find parks and activities that are near them.
* Used CSS and HTML for the base layout of the site to display the Map and nearby parks
* Used a Google API to get data to show the map and activities, as well as food spots
* Utilized Ember.js which helped structure the design and made the application cleaner and more cohesive.
